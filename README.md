# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
I developed a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python, Flask, and OpenCV to automate attendance tracking. The system opens a live camera feed, detects faces in real-time, and compares them with stored images to verify identity. When a match is found, the system marks the person as present and updates the attendance record, which is then displayed on a web page. It's designed to be fast and efficient, eliminating the need for manual attendance while ensuring accuracy through facial recognition technology.

# üß† Real-Time Face Recognition System with Stabilization

A robust, real-time face recognition system built using **Python**, combining the power of **OpenCV** for video capture and detection, **DeepFace (FaceNet)** for deep learning-based facial recognition, and a custom **FaceTracker** for smoothing and stabilization of detections across frames.

This system not only recognizes known faces but also **learns new ones interactively**, and saves them for future sessions. It is optimized for accuracy, stability, and user-friendly performance, making it ideal for personal or small-scale security and recognition systems.

## üöÄ Features

* **üì∑ Real-Time Face Detection**

  * Uses OpenCV‚Äôs Haar Cascades with tuned parameters for initial face localization.

* **üìå Smart Face Tracking & Stabilization**

  * Custom `FaceTracker` class tracks faces across frames, smoothing their movement and reducing jitter using exponential averaging and confidence accumulation.

* **üß† Deep Learning-Based Recognition**

  * Integrates DeepFace (using FaceNet backend) to convert faces into 128-dimensional embeddings for precise comparison using cosine similarity.

* **üßë‚Äçüíª Interactive Face Enrollment**

  * Detects new, unknown but stable faces and prompts the user via a Tkinter dialog to label them‚Äîallowing the system to learn dynamically.

* **üíæ Persistent Memory**

  * Saves known face embeddings (`face_data.pkl`) and associated names (`face_names.json`) across runs using `pickle` and `json`.

* **‚ö° Recognition Caching**

  * Temporarily stores recognition results for stable tracked faces to avoid redundant computation and improve frame processing speed.

* **üìä Real-Time Visual Feedback**

  * Draws bounding boxes, confidence levels, names, and stability scores on the webcam feed in real-time.

## üîß Prerequisites

Ensure the following packages are installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python deepface tensorflow scikit-learn
```

* Python ‚â• 3.7
* TensorFlow (GPU recommended for better performance)
* Tkinter (pre-installed with most Python versions)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Save the Script**
   Save the main Python code as `face_recognition_system.py`.

2. **Launch the App**

   ```bash
   python face_recognition_system.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the System**

   * The webcam feed opens.
   * Detected faces are tracked and analyzed.
   * Unknown but stable faces trigger a popup asking for a name.
   * Recognized faces are labeled in real-time.
   * Press `q` to exit the application.

## üìÅ Project Structure and Main Components

### ‚úÖ FaceTracker Class

Tracks and stabilizes bounding boxes across frames:

* **Smoothing**: Uses exponential averaging to reduce jitter.
* **Stability Check**: Requires a face to appear for `n` frames before considering it "stable".
* **Face Association**: Uses IOU (Intersection Over Union) to match new detections with tracked faces.
* **processed\_unknown\_faces**: Prevents duplicate prompts for the same unidentified face.

### ‚úÖ FaceRecognitionSystem Class

Main system logic:

* **Initialization**: Loads saved face data and sets up camera and detection.
* **Face Detection**: Uses `detect_faces_stable()` with preprocessing (equalization, blur, size/aspect ratio filters).
* **Face Encoding**: Uses DeepFace to get embeddings.
* **Recognition**: Uses cosine similarity for comparison and decision-making.
* **Interactive Learning**: Prompts user with `ask_for_name()` to label unknowns.
* **Caching**: Stores and reuses recent recognition results.
* **Main Loop** (`run_recognition()`):

  * Detects faces, updates tracker.
  * Recognizes stable faces.
  * Handles new faces.
  * Renders video with visual annotations.

## üß™ Troubleshooting

| Issue                       | Fix                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Error loading face data`   | Safe to ignore on first run. Files are created after first save.     |
| Tkinter dialog doesn‚Äôt show | Ensure the UI runs in the main thread (already handled)              |
| Slow processing             | Enable GPU for TensorFlow, or increase `recognition_interval`        |
| Poor recognition/detection  | Improve lighting, tune Haar cascade, or lower `confidence_threshold` |

## üí° Tips for Best Results

* Use well-lit environments.
* Ensure faces are clear and large enough during recognition or enrollment.
* Keep the camera steady for better tracking accuracy.
* Label only faces that are frontal and unobstructed.
